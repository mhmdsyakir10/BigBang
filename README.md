# Versa Asia Internship Challenges



# Problem:
There was a tale when 2 prime numbers collided and a big bang happened. Scientists found out
the 2 prime numbers are 3 and 5 but they need a model to generate an array of numbers to
predict when the big bang will happen again.

# Solution:
Create a script to iterate through 1 to 100 and replace any number divisible by 3 with the word
BIG number divisible by 5 with the word BANG. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace it
with BIG BANG. Generate the array and output to ‘output.json’ file with result as follow:

*[“1”, “2”, “BIG”, “4”, “BANG”, “BIG”, “7”, “8”, “BIG”, “BANG”, “11”, “BIG”, “13”, “14”, “BIGBANG”,
.... all the way to 100]*

# Guide to Run The Scripts using Visual Sudio Code
1. Click the Link Given:
```
https://github.com/mhmdsyakir10/BigBang
```
2. Click the "Versa Asia Challenges.ipynb"
3. Download the file by clicking "Download RAW File" at the top right upper corner
4. The file will be downloaded and save in your "Download" folder
5. Right click the file and choose "open with" and click Visual Studio Code
6. Run the first column (it will ask you to download the jupyter extension/intepreter)
7. After done run the first column, proceed run the second column and third column
8. After done run the third column, the 'output.json' file will be auto save the output file in your "Download" folder(usually beside the RAW file you download earlier)
9. Run the 'output.json' file with Visual Studio Code and you can see the output will be shown
